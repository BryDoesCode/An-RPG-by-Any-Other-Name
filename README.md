# An-RPG-by-Any-Other-Name
My final project when learning C# and Advanced Object Oriented Programming. Includes the exploration of WPFUI. Meant as a proof of concept demo.

Most of the included Interfaces and the random dice rolling class were provided by Bradley Beth. The gui system was created from the help of the Build a C#/WPF RPG tutorial by Scott Lilly: https://scottlilly.com/build-a-cwpf-rpg/

<b>Known Bugs</b>
Right-clicking and closing the character creation window will cause the game to start without checking for proper stat allocation, the name, or race choices.
